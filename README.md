## Quick start guide: DataHub + nbgitpuller

We will be using UC Berkeley's DataHub for at least the first bit of the course. Below is a tutorial on how to pull our homework into DataHub. DataHub will be the supported method for running and completing homework assignments. Although you are free to run the homeworks locally on your computer or another service that supports .ipynb (e.g. Google Colab), we cannot guarantee that other services are fully compatible with the auto-grader and will not be able to offer support with python distribution issues or bugs on anything other than DataHub.

1) Click the homework link above (or in bCourses).  
   - You will be redirected to UC Berkeley DataHub and prompted to log in with your CalNetID.
2) Wait for your server to start (first launch may take a few minutes).
3) nbgitpuller will automatically pull/update this repository into your home directory on DataHub.
4) When the file browser opens, navigate to the assignment notebook:
   - p188-288_hw1/HW_01.ipynb (or it may open automatically).
5) Open the notebook and start working.
6) Check the Python Kernel: Starting with HW3, we will be using astro.datahub for our homeworks, and we have our dedicated Python environment on there for the course. Make sure your Python kernel in JupyterLab is **Python(Physics188-288)**
7) Save frequently (File > Save or Ctrl/Cmd+S). Your DataHub home directory persists across sessions.

Notes:
- If you already have a copy, clicking the link again will merge in updates without deleting your work when possible.
- To avoid merge conflicts, consider making a working copy: File > Make a Copy (e.g., HW_01_working.ipynb).
- Before you submit to Gradescope, make sure to rename your file back to the original file name (e.g. HW_01_working -> HW_01). This is due to some peculiarities with our autograder setup.

## Working in the notebook

- Kernel: Use Python 3 on DataHub (preconfigured for the course).
- Run cells top-to-bottom; fix any errors before continuing.
- Use Kernel > Restart & Run All before submission to confirm a clean run.

## Submitting to Gradescope (Otter-Grader)

1) In the notebook, ensure all visible tests pass.
2) Do Kernel > Restart & Run All and verify the notebook completes without errors.
3) Download the notebook for submission:
   - Submit the zip file generated by Otter-Grader to Gradescope.
   - For HW1, we only asked you to submit the .ipynb file. For later homeworks, you will be required to submit the .zip file.
4) Go to Gradescope (via bCourses), open the assignment, and upload the .zip file.
5) Wait for the autograder to run. You can resubmit until the deadline; the highest score usually counts.

Important:
- Do not modify or delete test cells or assignment metadata.
- Submit only the .ipynb file; no additional files are required unless the assignment explicitly says so.

## Updating the assignment

Occasionally we may update the assignments to fix bugs or issues brought to us. If this were the case, we will make an announcement on bCourses saying so.

- Click the homework link again to pull updates via nbgitpuller.
- If you have local edits, make/keep a working copy (e.g., HW_01_working.ipynb) before pulling, then manually merge your changes if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- The notebook won’t open or kernels fail to start: Stop your server (Control Panel > Stop My Server) and relaunch; then click the homework link again.
- Merge/update issues after clicking the link: Make a copy of your notebook, then click the link to pull updates, and copy your solutions back into the updated notebook.
- Autograder failures that don’t reproduce locally: Restart & Run All and ensure no extra files/print statements alter outputs; re-download the .ipynb and resubmit.
- If there are updates to the assignment, click the homework link again to pull updates via nbgitpuller.
- If you have local edits, make/keep a working copy (e.g., HW_01_working.ipynb) before pulling, then manually merge your changes if needed.
