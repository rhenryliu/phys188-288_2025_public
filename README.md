## Quick start guide: DataHub + nbgitpuller

We will be using UC Berkeley's DataHub for at least the first bit of the course. Below is a tutorial on how to pull our homework into DataHub. You are also free to run the notebooks locally on your computer or another service that supports .ipynb (e.g. Google Colab), however we cannot guarantee that other services are fully compatible with the auto-grader and maintaining compatibility will be up to you.

1) Click the homework link below (or in bCourses).  
   - You will be redirected to UC Berkeley DataHub and prompted to log in with CalNet.
2) Wait for your server to start (first launch may take a few minutes).
3) nbgitpuller will automatically pull/update this repository into your home directory on DataHub.
4) When the file browser opens, navigate to the assignment notebook:
   - p188-288_hw1/HW_01.ipynb (or it may open automatically).
5) Open the notebook and start working.
6) Save frequently (File > Save or Ctrl/Cmd+S). Your DataHub home directory persists.

Notes:
- If you already have a copy, clicking the link again will merge in updates without deleting your work when possible.
- To avoid merge conflicts, consider making a working copy: File > Make a Copy (e.g., HW_01_working.ipynb).

## Working in the notebook

- Kernel: Use Python 3 on DataHub (preconfigured for the course).
- Run cells top-to-bottom; fix any errors before continuing.
- Use Kernel > Restart & Run All before submission to confirm a clean run.

## Submitting to Gradescope (Otter-Grader)

1) In the notebook, ensure all visible tests pass.
2) Do Kernel > Restart & Run All and verify the notebook completes without errors.
3) Download the notebook for submission:
   - File > Download > Notebook (.ipynb) to save the .ipynb file locally.
   - Do not use Otter’s Export; do not submit a .zip.
4) Go to Gradescope (via bCourses), open the assignment, and upload the .ipynb.
5) Wait for the autograder to run. You can resubmit until the deadline; the highest score usually counts.

Important:
- Do not modify or delete test cells or assignment metadata.
- Submit only the .ipynb file; no additional files are required unless the assignment explicitly says so.

## Updating the assignment

Occasionally we may update the assignments to fix bugs or issues brought to us. If this were the case, we will make an announcement on bCourses saying so.

- Click the homework link again to pull updates via nbgitpuller.
- If you have local edits, make/keep a working copy (e.g., HW_01_working.ipynb) before pulling, then manually merge your changes if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- The notebook won’t open or kernels fail to start: Stop your server (Control Panel > Stop My Server) and relaunch; then click the homework link again.
- Merge/update issues after clicking the link: Make a copy of your notebook, then click the link to pull updates, and copy your solutions back into the updated notebook.
- Autograder failures that don’t reproduce locally: Restart & Run All and ensure no extra files/print statements alter outputs; re-download the .ipynb and resubmit.
- If there are updates to the assignment, click the homework link again to pull updates via nbgitpuller.
- If you have local edits, make/keep a working copy (e.g., HW_01_working.ipynb) before pulling, then manually merge your changes if needed.
